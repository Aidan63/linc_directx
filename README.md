# linc/directx
Haxe/hxcpp bindings for DXGI, D3D11, and D3DCompiler.

This is a [linc](http://snowkit.github.io/linc/) library.

This library works with the Haxe cpp target only.

### Install

`haxelib git linc_directx https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_directx`

### Usage

This library is still new and doesn't cover much of the directx API. Enough is included to draw basic textured quads and compile vertex and pixel shaders, but not much more than that right now.

Bindings have been created for my own directx learning experience and personal usage so bindings will be added as and when I need them. Hopefully they will cover most of the API in time.
